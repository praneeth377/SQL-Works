# AtliQ Hardware Technologies: Ad-Hoc Insights
## Introduction and Problem Statement
Participating in the Code Basics SQL Challenge, I delved into ad-hoc analysis for the esteemed AtliQ Hardware Technologies. As a prominent computer hardware producer in India, and extending its footprint globally, AtliQ Hardware posed intriguing queries that demanded insightful SQL responses. The ad-hoc requests can be seen [here](https://github.com/praneeth377/AtliQ_Hardware_Ad-Hoc_Analysis-SQL/blob/main/ad-hoc-requests.pdf).

## Schema Description
The schema comprises a total of 6 tables, each contributing essential information:
* Customer: Encompasses details such as customer names, codes, preferred platforms, channels, and residential locations.
* Product: Holds comprehensive product information including names, codes, divisions, and categories.
* Manufacturing_Cost: Captures the manufacturing cost of each product, establishing a connection with the Product table through a foreign key, product_code.
* Gross_Sales: Documents the revenue generated by each product, linked to the Product table via the product_code.
* Sales: Serves as the nexus between the Customer and Product tables, containing customer_code, product_code, fiscal_year of purchase, and quantities for each product bought.
* Invoice_Deductions: Records discount percentages offered to customers, establishing a connection with the Customer table through the customer_code foreign key.

## Ad-Hoc Insights
Diving into the Code Basics SQL Challenge for AtliQ Hardware Technologies, the queries navigated complex mathematical analyses, showcasing the company's performance and customer dynamics. Extracting product successes, identifying key customers, and calculating percentage sales increases between fiscal years employed a diverse array of SQL clauses and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

The examination of gross sales data revealed a consistent uptrend from FY 2020 to FY 2021, indicative of the company's positive trajectory. Notably, the identification of the top 3 products sold in quantity from each product division presents actionable insights for strategic business focus. These conclusions derived from varied queries contribute to a comprehensive understanding of AtliQ Hardware's market positioning and potential areas for business enhancement.

## Conclusions
In conclusion, this SQL Challenge enhanced my proficiency in utilizing diverse SQL clauses and CTEs for intricate analyses, providing valuable insights into AtliQ Hardware's operational landscape. The ability to draw meaningful conclusions, such as identifying high-performing products and discerning customer behavior, will undoubtedly contribute to informed decision-making in future data-driven projects.
